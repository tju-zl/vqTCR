## Getting started
1. Tutorials of preprocessing the adaptive immune data: refer to folder `pre_data`.
2. Benchmark results of vqTCR and other methods: refer to folder `benchmark`.
3. Case study of SCC patient results: refer to folder `case_study`.

## Dataset
Please refer to the supplementarial materials to get the download links (or in the notebook of tutorials).

Note: we prepared the preprocessed dataset in the folder `pre_data\prepared_data`.

## Key software dependencies
- Scanpy 1.9.8
- Pytorch 2.0.1
- Scirpy 0.22.3 (must after 0.13.1)
- Srublet 0.2.3
